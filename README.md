This repository contains the solution for the LauzHack 2024 hackathon UBS challenge. We document our exploratory data analysis, model building, and submission process in this repository.

Thanks to the challenge organizers for providing us with the opportunity to work on this interesting problem statement!

*Note: The contents of the `data/` directory have been omitted from this repository due to the large file sizes. If trying to replicate, please source the ubs challenge files and place them in the root `data/` directory before running the code.*
